# Dual-Core Lockstep (DCLS)

This chapter describes the proposed Dual-Core Lockstep functionality and its future implementation in the VeeR EL2 Core, as required by Caliptra 2.0 for side-channel mitigation scenarios, although it may be useful for other applications like rad-hardening or other safety related-scenarios which DCLS is often also used for.

## VeeR EL2 DCLS Overview

The lockstep feature will be added as an optional feature of VeeR EL2, disabled by default.
If enabled, another copy of the VeeR EL2 CPU core will be additionally instantiated in the design.
This second core will be referred to as a Shadow Core in this chapter.

The Shadow Core is delayed by a constant, configurable `DELAY` number of clock cycles with regards to the main core.

The `DCCM` and `ICCM` memories are not duplicated, and only the main VeeR EL2 CPU core has access to them.
The Shadow Core is only supplied with the delayed inputs of the main core, including the relevant `DCCM` and `ICCM` data, without any ability to read from or write to those memories by itself.

Similarly, `Icache` is not duplicated with only the main VeeR EL2 CPU core having direct access.
The Shadow Core will receive a delayed copy of main core's `Icache` inputs.
The copy of main core's `Icache` outputs will be passed into the `Equivalency Checker` to be validated against the Shadow Core's `Icache` outputs.

The diagram below outlines the architecture of the proposed solution.

![VeeR DCLS Overview](img/dcls_block_diagram.png)

Outputs and the register file from the main core are delayed by `DELAY` cycles and passed to the `Equivalency Checker` for verification against the outputs and the register file of the Shadow Core.

### Error Policy

Depending on the application and its security requirements, one of the following error policies can be configured:

* Detected error will be reported using the detection bit and the cores' execution flow will proceed.
* Detected error will trigger an interrupt and halt the execution until the interrupt is handled.
* Detected error will escalate the problem to the external controller and await the reset of the system.

It is up to the integrator to choose the error policy and provide a handler logic (e.g. external reset block).

### Monitored Registers

The Shadow Core can have its internal copy of the register file by setting a proper VeeR EL2 configuration flag.
Even though every discrepancy between register files of the Main Core and Shadow Core will eventually lead to difference between IOs of these modules, it might take some time for the mismatch to manifest.
To determine whether a discrepancy has occurred immediately, the register files from both cores will be compared taking into account a reasonable subset of the VeeR EL2 registers, as defined in the table below:

```{note}
Should the monitored registers be dependent on the VeeR configuration?
```

### Monitored IOs

Since the Shadow Core module must replicate the behavior of the Main Core without any differences, it contains the same input and output ports.
Input ports are delayed and routed to the copy of the VeeR EL2 CPU, output ports are compared with the delayed output ports of the Main Core.
Refer to {ref}`tab-shadow-core-tracked-signals` for list of ports routed to the Shadow Core.

Signals not compared due to their special meaning:

## Shadow Core Control

The DCLS module exposes control logic that can be potentially connected to the external CSR.
Specific signals available as the module ports are described in the {ref}`tab-shadow-core-control-signals`.
The error injection logic is a part of the Shadow Core and its purpose is to test whether the lockstep module operates correctly and to disable it if needed.
Error is injected by asserting the `corruption_detected_o` output signal even if there is no corruption error detected between the Shadow Core and the Main Core.

:::

## Configuration

```{warning}
The DCLS feature is not supported in Debug Mode.
Entering Debug Mode with DCLS enabled will disable DCLS until the next reset.
```

The DCLS feature can be enabled via `-set lockstep_enable=1` option.
There are two configuration options:
* `-set lockstep_delay={2, 3, 4}` - the delay applied on the Shadow Core between 2 and 4 cycles,
* `-set lockstep_regfile_enable=1` - enable exposing the VeeR Register File so the Shadow Core will have an internal copy to compare with the Main Core Register File.

The configuration options are ignored and their macros are not generated if the Dual Core Lockstep feature is disabled.

## Validation Plan

The DCLS feature will be tested within:

* Software DCLS [smoke test](https://github.com/chipsalliance/Cores-VeeR-EL2/tree/main/testbench/tests/dcls/dcls.c) - covers VeeR CPU core with the Shadow Core execution flow.
* RTL `el2_veer_lockstep` [module tests](https://github.com/chipsalliance/Cores-VeeR-EL2/tree/main/verification/block/dcls) - covers the Shadow Core by itself.

  - Detection bit is asserted upon encountered corruption. Error behavior follows the relevant error handling policy. No action is taken if no corruption was introduced.
* - Comments
  - The default path will likely be more easily testable with the help of the software testbench. It should be possible to simulate a fault injection via mailbox see: [top_tb.sv](https://github.com/chipsalliance/Cores-VeeR-EL2/blob/795eb588e34b6815033b769d54fcf7cfac4aae3a/testbench/tb_top.sv#L727).

  - Detection bit is not raised. Detection interrupt is not asserted. The test provides the same results as the VeeR EL2 CPU core without the DCLS feature enabled.
* - Comments
  - It might be beneficial to use a software test with a program that will produce a result that can by easily compared to an alternative flow and also engage the VeeR EL2 core. Consider matrix multiplication.
